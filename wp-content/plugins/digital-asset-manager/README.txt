Keep a record of all your themes and plugins purchased from the different marketplace in one place and manage credentials.

== Description ==

The Digital Asset Manager plugin is not for end-user. It is intentionally built for Freelancers and WordPress Agencies to manage all the plugins and themes in one place. All assets are either purchased by themselves or by their clients. It will greatly help you organize your assets and save time with time.

== How it can help you to save time? ==

To understand how it will save your precious time consider the following real-time scenarios.

= Scenario 1 =

Consider you are in a tech call with your client and he shares some requirements. After knowing the requirements, you think that this feature can be manageable by a plugin I had bought some time ago but right now can't remember what is the name of that plugin, from which marketplace you have bought it, and what email did you use to create an account to buy it.

searching in your email, Google Drive, or DropBox to find out the asset is time taking and frustrated. Isn't it? Keeping all the assets in one place will enable search only in a single directory.

= Scenario 2 =

To set up a feature, you are waiting for your client to share the required plugins and themes to get started. And your client is busy with other stuff and unable to provide it on time. As result, there will be a delay in order delivery.

But you know that your other client had bought the same plugin and shared the files with you. You have added those files with the license key in Digital Asset Manager. What you would do? Use the plugin file from the previous developer and start work on the project. When the client provides the required plugins with a key, you just have to update the license key.

= Scenario 3 =

Consider as a WordPress Agency or Freelancer, you are providing maintenance service to your prestigious clients and keep their site up to date on regular basis. It is recommended to test all the updates on a staging server and after testing; push the changes to production. Let's suppose, there are some paid plugins installed on the client site. To test the update, we have to add a purchase key or license on the staging server as well. So will you buy a separate key for this task? No, no. Simply unlink the key from the production site, grab the key, register the license key on the staging server, update the plugin, test it, un-register the key, and put it back on the production. Does it make sense?

What if the key on production is hidden and you have to dig into the database to grab it? This will take your time. Maybe you have managed all the keys on a Google sheet or in DropBox. And employees in your agency are managing their records in separate files. So the data is scattered in different places. With this plugin, all the data can be managed in a single place that can be accessed by any team member.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do the visibility settings do? =

Visibility options enable/disable the single and archive pages. If you want to store the asset for your agency's internal purpose, keep the visibility of asset post type and asset type taxonomy private.

= Is the plugin providing the single and archive page template? =

No, currently this feature is not included. But we are working on it and it will be available in the next release. Your theme default single and archive page templates will be used to render the content if you have set the visibility to the public.
