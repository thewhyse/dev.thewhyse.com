This plugin generates the proper security HTTP response headers to keep your site secured.
 
== Description ==
 
This plugin generates the proper security HTTP response headers, attempts to generate a valid Content Security Policy, and sets browser permissions if configured. 
 
== Installation ==
 
1. Download the plugin, unzip it, and upload to your sites `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
    1. You can also upload it directly to your Plugins admin
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
 
== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= What is a Content Security Policy? =
 
A Content Security Policy is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.
 
= Will this detect every external source in my site? =
 
Unfortunately, no.   While it will make every best effort to do so, it cannot capture external resources inside already external resources.

= How do I automatically generate a Content Security Policy using your plugin? =

Login to shell for your site, change directory to your websites root folder, and run `wp csp generate`.  Have some patience because it can take some time to run. Please make sure to run it a few times, I cannot guarantee that it will get everything, but, in my tests on my own sites it did.

      taken care of for you.
    * Just in case it does not work 100%, please export your settings before updating to this version and 
      perform a search and replace for the string to remove it:
        * Search: "kp_cspgen_"
        * Replace: null|nothing|empty
    * NOTE: If you do not export your settings I will not guarantee that you will not have to reconfigure the plugin.
      Although... I did take a backup ;) You will need to hop into your database to grab it though, it will be in your
      options table, and it is called: `wpsh_TEMP_settings`.  I will have this automatically removed in a future update
* Add: Option to remove server advertising.
* Add: Expect-CT header
    * The Expect-CT header lets sites opt in to reporting and/or enforcement of Certificate Transparency requirements, 
      to prevent the use of misissued certificates for that site from going unnoticed.
    * Doc: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Expect-CT

* Updated: Feature Policies.

      unoptimized-images, unsized-media, web-share

    * Added: Descriptive descriptions for each directive
    * Reworked: Settings for the entire section, which of course caused me to rewrite the way they are implemented.

= 2.2.15 =
* Implement: The 2 new headers documentation and implementation tabs SMH

= 2.2.13 =
* Deprecated: The X-XSS-Protection header has been deprecated by modern browsers. 
    * As a result we are marking the setting, hook, and functionality to set it as deprecated and 
      will be removed in future versions of this plugin.
    * Doc: https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#x-xss-protection
    * Set to log as deprecated
* Rework: Settings Fields
    * found it was causing a conflict with another plugin
* Add: 2 new Headers
    * Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy
        * This response header (also named COEP) prevents a document from loading any cross-origin resources that don’t 
          explicitly grant the document permission
        * https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#cross-origin-embedder-policy
        * Hook: `wpsh_coep_header`
    * Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy
        * This response header (also named COOP) allows you to ensure a top-level document does not share a browsing 
          context group with cross-origin documents. COOP will process-isolate your document and potential attackers can’t 
          access to your global object if they were opening it in a popup, preventing a set of cross-origin attacks dubbed XS-Leaks
        * https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#cross-origin-opener-policy
        * Hook: `wpsh_coop_header`
* NOTE: There is no full browser support yet for Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy, so for now it is going to be left out.  As a result,
  the only option for the Embedder Policy is "unsafe-none".  Once it is fully cross-browser this header will be implemented.
